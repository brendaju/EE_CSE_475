1. The package sources are updated:
    sudo apt-get update

2. We install the required packages (confirm with Y):
    sudo apt-get install gcc make build-essential python-dev git scons swig
  
3. The audio output must be deactivated. For this we edit the file
    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf
Here we add the following line:
    blacklist snd_bcm2835
Then the file is saved by pressing CTRL + O and CTRL + X closes the editor.

4. We also need to edit the configuration file:
      sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Below are lines with the following content (with Ctrl + W you can search):

# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
    dtparam=audio=on
This bottom line is commented out with a hashtag # at the beginning of the line: #dtparam=audio=on

5. We restart the system
    sudo reboot

6. Now we can download the library.
    git clone https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x

7. In this directory are on the one hand some C files included, which can be easily compiled. The example code for this is easy to understand.
In order to use them in Python, we need to compile them:
    cd rpi_ws281x/
    sudo scons
    cd python

8. Here we carry out the installation:
    sudo python3 setup.py build 
    sudo python3 setup.py install 
    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel

9. Test
    sudo nano examples/strandtest.py
